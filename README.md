# Machine Learning with image recognition [CSC311 A1]

This is a project from the Machine Learning course from the University of Toronto.

The project begin with basic use case of library NumPy, then uses it to perform matrix transformation, and organize large data to enable python to run faster and more efficient.

Then the project implements basic linear regression and logistic regression and gradient decent, building up to using KNN mechine learning algorithm to differentate written text from source data matrix.
